### **<u>Wireframes</u>**

As part of the design process, before starting the project we made initial wireframes using Lucidchart. Creating these mock-ups helped me plan the basic structure and arrangement of the features for our site.

The final design has been influenced by the team and mentor feedback so the wireframes map the journey from idea to functioning app.

### **<u>Design</u>**

**Structure**

- A simple clean design with easy to use buttons handles the navigation throughout the app.


**Typography**

- The main font used throughout the site is 'Roboto' which belongs to the sans-serif typeface family. The font is clean and elegant, making it a good choice for web design.

- We have used the 'MedievalSharp' font for titles and headers all over the site.

- Sans Serif is set as the fallback font if for any reason the main fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly.


**Logo Design**

- I created my own logo design with inspiration from old school operating systems. Using the greater than symbol  to create a simple but effective logo.

- Following website conventions, my website logo is a link to the homepage. Over time many people have learned that clicking on a site’s logo leads them back to the homepage so adopting this standard reduces confusion by matching the UI to users’ expectations. The logo is also left-aligned which is the most familiar placement, and is where users look to find it.


### <u>**User stories**</u>

    * Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
5. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    * GitHub was used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
7. [GitPod:](https://gitpod.io)
